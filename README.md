# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Overview

Customer segmentation is a critical process for businesses to understand their customer base. It involves dividing customers into distinct groups (segments) based on certain characteristics such as age, spending habits, gender, etc. This project uses **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to cluster customers based on their spending behavior and demographic data.

In this project, the goal is to segment customers visiting a mall into groups based on factors such as annual income, age, and spending score. The K-Means algorithm is applied to identify patterns and group customers accordingly. These insights can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies, products, and services to specific customer segments.

### K-Means Clustering

K-Means is an iterative clustering algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into **K** pre-defined clusters. It works by finding the centroid of each cluster and assigning data points to the nearest centroid. The algorithm minimizes the **intra-cluster distance** (distance between points within a cluster) and maximizes the **inter-cluster distance** (distance between centroids of clusters).

### Steps in the Project

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Import necessary libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.).
   - Load and inspect the dataset.
   - Clean the data by handling missing values and removing irrelevant features.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Standardize the data using **StandardScaler** to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.
   
3. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Use the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters (`K`).
   - Apply the **K-Means algorithm** to partition the customers into different segments.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize the customer segments using scatter plots and other graphical tools.
   - Analyze the customer segments to gain actionable insights into spending behavior and demographics.

### Code Example

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load and clean the dataset
customer_data = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')
customer_data = customer_data.drop('Gender', axis=1)  # Drop irrelevant column

# Standardize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(customer_data)

# Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters
wcss = []
for i in range(1, 11):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=i, init='k-means++', random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(scaled_data)
    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)
plt.plot(range(1, 11), wcss)
plt.title('Elbow Method')
plt.xlabel('Number of Clusters')
plt.ylabel('WCSS')
plt.show()

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about customer demographics and their spending habits. It includes the following features:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Gender**: Customer's gender (not used in clustering)
- **Age**: Age of the customer
- **Annual Income**: Customer’s annual income (in thousands)
- **Spending Score**: Score based on customer’s spending behavior

The dataset can be found in the repository, or you can use any similar customer segmentation dataset.

## Repository Setup

### Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation-using-k-means.git

Create a Virtual Environment
To ensure all dependencies are installed properly, create a virtual environment and activate it:

Using pip
bash
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
Using Conda (Optional)
If you prefer using Conda, refer to the Conda Environment Management documentation.

Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required for this project:

- pandas: For data manipulation
- numpy: For numerical operations
- matplotlib: For data visualization
- seaborn: For statistical data visualization
- sklearn: For machine learning algorithms
- To install the required libraries, run:

bash
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn
Running the Jupyter Notebook
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project in a Jupyter Notebook. If you don't have Jupyter installed, you can install it using:

bash
```
pip install jupyter
To start the notebook, run:

bash
```
jupyter notebook
This will open the Jupyter interface in your web browser, where you can open and run the customer_segmentation.ipynb notebook.

Results & Insights
By applying K-Means clustering, we segmented the customers into 4 clusters based on their annual income, age, and spending habits. Here are the insights:

-Cluster 1: High-income, high-spending customers
-Cluster 2: Low-income, low-spending customers
-Cluster 3: Middle-income, average-spending customers
-Cluster 4: High-spending, lower-income customers
These segments allow businesses to target customers with tailored marketing strategies and improve customer experience.

##Future Improvements
Adding More Features: You can improve the model by adding additional features like customer location, purchase history, etc.
Advanced Clustering Algorithms: Explore algorithms like DBSCAN or Agglomerative Clustering.
Prediction Models: Implement supervised learning models to predict customer behavior based on the segments.
